## Description

This one-page web app displays an updated professional portfolio, showcasing a selection of projects I have worked and collaborated on, that was built with React front-end. The app allows information to load without refreshing the page, and a number of different components.

This Node application uses various npm packages and libraries such as `react-pdf` and `react-icons`.

Further, `gh-pages` package is used to deploy this app on server.

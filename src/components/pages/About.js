            I previously completed an Internship as a UI/UX Designer with a young start-up, which
            has now been expanded globally. However, that opportunity gave me a glimpse into the
            endless possibilities in the existing tech industry. Currently, pursuing a coding
            bootcamp with Trilogy education to further strengthen my skills in Web development with
            various technologies and frameworks. This course also offers a more organised roadmap to
            become a confident developer/coder in widely used web development frameworks.
